👋 Hi, I’m Sai Deepa Reddy Vaddi!
🎓 Master’s student at Carnegie Mellon University in Artificial Intelligence and Innovation (GPA: 3.71).
💻 Passionate about solving challenging AI problems across domains like generative AI, NLP, computer vision, and MLOps.

🧠 My expertise spans:

-Developing scalable AI systems using PyTorch, TensorFlow, and LangChain
-Crafting synthetic data pipelines with Nvidia Omniverse and Gaussian Splatting
-Optimizing large language models for fairness, safety, and performance
🌟 Highlights:

-Fine-tuned Stable Diffusion to align outputs with user preferences, improving safety and performance.
-Built end-to-end recommendation systems and real-time defect detection pipelines, leveraging edge AI.
-Published research on multimodal fusion for fake news detection with transformers (RoBERTa, ViT).
🔍 I’m eager to tackle new AI challenges—from research to deployment. Let’s push the boundaries of what’s possible with artificial intelligence!
